# Tales of Erenix

The purpose of this website/app is to provide a platform for readers to explore and immerse themselves in the universe of Erenix. It contains a collection of all my stories, tales, and short narratives set in this unique fantasy world I have created.

## What problem does this solve?

This platform serves as a central repository for all the content related to the universe of Erenix, making it easy for readers to access, explore, and enjoy the stories. It also helps in organizing the content systematically and presenting it in an engaging manner.

## Goals

- Provide a comprehensive collection of stories, tales, and narratives from the universe of Erenix.
- Offer an intuitive and engaging user experience for readers.
- Ensure the content is accessible across various devices, including tablets, cell phones, and computers.

## Technical Breakdown

The initial version of the site was developed using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. However, moving forward, I plan to migrate the project to React/NextJS for better scalability and maintainability. TailwindCSS will be used for styling to ensure a responsive and modern design.

### Backend

The backend will primarily be developed using JavaScript. I will also consider using a database, such as MongoDB, to manage and organize the stories and related content.

### Frontend

The frontend will be built with React/NextJS, and TailwindCSS will be used for styling to create a responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.
